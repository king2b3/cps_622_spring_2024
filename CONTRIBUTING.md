# Branching
Create your own branch, off of the development branch, to add your new joke.
You can name it whatever you see fit (feature, your name, etc.).
Just don't name it after any other reserved names (hotfix, dev, testing, main, etc.).

Once your have commited your changes, create a pull request into the dev branch.

# Pull Requests
+ Branches should merged into development via Pull-Requests.
+ Pull-Requests should always have at least one reviewer, which in this case is me.
    + The reviewer(s) should be the ones to close discussions and merge the branch.
    + All reviewers must approve the work before a pull request is completed.
+ Required Reviewers
