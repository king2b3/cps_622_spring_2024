Assignment 3 Public Repository for CPS 622 at the Unviersity of Dayton.

Your assignment is to properly add a new joke to this repository!
Sound simple enough, and it really is!
If this is your first time using Git (and GitHub), you'll need to do the following:
+ Create a GitHub account, and locally clone a repo
+ Make local changes, and push them to a remote repository
+ Merge your changes into a development branch.

The only code you need to write, is adding a new joke to the repository, by editing the source code.
There are automated tests that will confirm that your changes didn't break functionality.

## Steps
Here are the general steps you need to follow....
(Note: Your exact steps might vary slightly, but this should be the workflow for most of you)
+ Create a GitHub account
+ Clone this repo, either through SSH or with a GUI application.
    + This will probably be the hardest part for you, I would watch some tutorials.
    + You can create SSH keys, use a Personal Access Token with HTTPS, or use GUI apps through GitHub.
    + I'd recommend taking the time to learn this through the command line, with SSH.
+ Create a new branch off of the development branch, either through the command line, or in the GitHub web tool.
+ Commit your local changes to this new branch, and push it to the remote repo.
+ Create a pull request into the development branch, with your changes on your branch.
+ Make any edits myself, or the TA request in the pull request.

## Grading
This assignment is basically a pass / fail grade.
Making a joke isn't really the test (at least I hope not), its understanding the Git workflow, and being able to contrinute to a repo properly.
